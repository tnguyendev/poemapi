## How It's Made:

Languages/frameworks use: HTML, CSS, JavaScript

## Thoughts:

This project gave me so much grief. I really wanted to do a poem API, but the most popular one was behind a pay wall...and the free version they did not give me a key to use until much after the project was due. I had to look through SO many API's to finally find the one that I needed. This one gives more dated poems, and MANY of them were VERY long. I think one had a hundred lines. I had to trim it down to 10 lines to fit the page (did not want people scrolling to see the rest of the poem). ALSO, CSS did not come out with how I wanted it to be. I wanted the lines to be diagonal across the page but flex box froggy did not want to work with me. Spent a good hour trying to figure it out before I gave up and decided that a simple centered text was as good as it was going to get.
